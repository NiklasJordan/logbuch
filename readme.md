# ðŸ““ Logbuch â€“ simple, email-based static site generator

Logbuch is a stupid simple static site generator feeded by old-fashion emails.

The entire idea behind Logbuch is to have a stupid simple entry to post new content and the advantages of a static pages. Without all the complexity of caring about updates or managing content through the backend.

Abilities and Features:

* Completely platform independently for hosting and email.
* Simple HTML template based on Jinja2.
* Just <100 lines of Python.
* Compiles down to purely static files; JavaScript-free.

| This project was created due to my own needs. I do not guarantee that it is free of bugs. The script is just <100 lines of dirty (I mean really dirty!) Python code and I recommend you to take a look in there yourself before you use it for yourself.              |

## The story behind

Often content management systems are very complex, both in development and in management and maintenance. I love technology without a lot of bells and whistles and was looking for a way to start a photo blog very simply and without platform dependency. 

My plan: I just send an email with my post somewhere and the pictures in the attachment. Magic happens and bang... static page is generated. Unfortunately, I have not found such a thing and therefore now developed this for myself. Logbuch is simple, comprehensible and platform independent.

## How it works?

This is the very simple procedure:
1. Send an email with defined subject and your post content to a defined email adress.
2. The script is looking automatically for new emails in the inbox with the defines subject.
3. If there is a new email, the script extracts the content, saves the attachements and
4. generate the static files including the new post and save them into the /site/ directory.

Pretty simple, right?!

## Get started

### Installation

Just copy the files on your server:

Â´Â´Â´
$ git clone https://github.com/NiklasJordan/Logbuch.git
Â´Â´Â´

### Configuration

Rename the Â´config-copy.jsonÂ´ to Â´config.jsonÂ´ and fill out and customize it with your data.

### Add a cronjob (optional)

To achieve a fully automated process, I recommend creating a cronjob that runs site.py at regular intervals to scan the inbox for new posts and regenerate the page if necessary.

That's all. Now you can start with your postings.

## Usage

Just send an email with the defined subject from your config.json with your content to your defined target email adress. If you added a cronjob, you have nothing else to do. Otherwise, you have to run the Â´site.pyÂ´.

### Use a iOS shortcut (optional)

I'm using a simple iOS shortcut to generate and send the emails. This let me select one or more photos and open a modal for the text, afterwards it's sends automatically to the right adress and with the right subject.

## Next steps

I would like to implement the following features:

* [ ] Add infinite scrolling for better performance
* [ ] Compress the photos before saving
* [ ] Add a RSS feed
